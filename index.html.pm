◊h1{At Book's End}

◊section{Welcome to ◊em{At Book's End}. We have been reading books together since January 2019 with the aim to read one book per month. As described in the ◊hyperlink["rules.html"]{rules}, we restrict ourselves to themes for each cycle of the circle---the first and current theme is fantasy.
