The basic idea is that we will take turns choosing books to read, and that we will read one book per month. At the end of the month we will meet to discuss the book. We may or may not eat cheese and / or drink beer. For each cycle of reading there will be a theme. The non-hidden terms and conditions are</p><ul><li>We will only read books which no one of us have finished before.</li><li>The book must be available in English or Swedish.</li><li>The book must be available both in ebook format and in physical form.</li><li>If the book belongs to a series then it has to be the first book of that series.</li><li>Any author may only be featured once.</li><li><p>At the end of a cycle we will vote for the theme of the next cycle. The rules for voting are as follows.</p><ul class=\"sublist\"><li>Any member may suggest a theme.</li><li>A member may not vote for their own theme.</li><li>Ties will be broken through a dice roll.</li><li>The member who proposed the winning theme will be the first to choose a book in the next cycle.</li></ul></li><li>The book club will have at least one spreadsheet.</li></ul></section></root></article></body>\n</html>"
